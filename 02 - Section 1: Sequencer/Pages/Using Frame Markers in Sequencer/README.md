# Using Frame Markers in Sequencer

<p>Occasionally when working with Sequencer, there may be frames within your cinematic that you want to keep track of. Maybe you want to come back and make changes at a later time or perhaps you want to insert different content at a particular time in your cinematic. Whatever your case may be, you can use<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Frame Markers<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>to add a mark to your Sequence at a desired time, enabling you to see from a glance, "points of interest" that you define.</p>
<p>In this How-to, we'll show you how to add, toggle, and remove Frame Markers as well as shortcuts for jumping between markers.</p>
